## About me
I am a software engineer with 3+ years of professional experience in the IT industry with around 3 years of experience working in small businesses as a Project Manager, Team leader, Tech Lead, and content manager before starting my full-time career.

Here are some of the technologies I work on:
- NodeJS
- .NET
- Angular/React
- Flask/Django
- Blockchain - Ethereum(Daaps)
- GCP
- Ionic
- Languages - JS, TS, Python, C#, Solidity, C++, Java, Go

I love building software solutions and believe that only if we start, then we can change the world. That is why I am constantly hustling after and before my full-time job to make our world a better place. Recently, I built my own scripting language called "lazy Language" which is built over python with a more simplified syntax and resembles pseudocode. It is uploaded to GitHub as an open-source. You can check the projects section in my profile. Some other open-source projects are NPM Packages: sockhttp, string-analysis.
Sockhttp is a simple library to create simple and secure APIs
String-Analysis is used to detect the tone of a sentence with detection and filtration of bad words. You can also fetch nouns, adjectives, and verbs from a sentence.

With a keen interest in management roles, I have been studying project management and love practicing it on a personal project "Downbeat". It s a Mental Health Support Group is started with the belief that every single one of us is resilient, and that our resilience can be fostered with the help and support of a community. Our members provide the place and space for personal growth, self-reflection, learning, and bonding.

For fun, I love doodling, writing, reading, cooking, playing guitar, ukulele, and drums, skating, swimming, and run around with a football.

Have a great day!
